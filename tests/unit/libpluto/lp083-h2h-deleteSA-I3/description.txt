This test case continues lp082, where the IKEv2 original Responder will delete
a child SA (before the original initiator).  In this test case, we are the
Initiator and we will receive the request to delete the child SA for the first
time.

NOTE: To simulate behaviour of Strongswan, the other end (lp082) sent us
a CREATE_CHILD_SA message with msgid of 0.

This uses the I1/R1/I2/R2/I3 pcap files from lp036 thru lp039.  Some packets
come from lp082.

# NOTE: in the real exchange, the Initiator would first send out a
# CREATE_CHILD_SA, which is already tested for in other test cases.  Here, we
# skip negotiating CHILD SA #3, and skip directly to the Responder initiating
# the deletion of #2, which is what's being tested.
