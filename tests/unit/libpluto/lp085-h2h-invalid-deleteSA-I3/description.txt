This test case continues lp082, where the IKEv2 original Responder will delete a
child SA (before the original Initiator).  In this test case, we are the
Initiator and we will receive the request (from lp082) to delete the child SA
for the first time.

This test case bulds on lp082/lp083/lp084 where this transaction was successful.
Instead, lp085 simulates an encrypted request that cannot be handled, and a
failed notification is sent out to lp086.

This uses the I1/R1/I2/R2/I3 pcap files from lp036 thru lp039.  Some packets come
from lp082.

# skip negotiating CHILD SA #3, and skip directly to the Responder initiating
# the deletion of #2, which is what's being tested.
