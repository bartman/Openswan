This test case is a continuation of lp061,lp062,lp063,lp064,lp065, where the
initiator is behind NAT.

In this test case, the IKEv2 original initiator is attempting to replace the
IKE (parent) SA.  The action is triggered through EVENT_SA_REPLACE.  This
results in a INFORMATIONAL/D message being emitted, and a new IKE (parent) SA
initiated.

This test case uses R1/R2 pcap files from lp061~lp065.
